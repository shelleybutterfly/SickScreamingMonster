One Last Monster Script To Cough All Over Them All. This One Isn't Great. But It's To A Good Purpose. :)

NOTE: 
   I forked this from wchill's repo; however, since this is really a recombination and then total
   hacky mash-up (and not even a pretty one) of so many things, that I have just stripped it down
   and noted the source material and am letting it stand by itself.

   Source material: (in no particular order, and, yes, I realize SteamDatabase was deriviative)
          https://github.com/wchill/Steam
          https://github.com/YeOldeWH/MonsterMinigameWormholeWarp
          https://github.com/SteamDatabase/steamSummerMinigame

of course: 
      
      THE STEAM SUMMER MONSTER MINIGAME! 
      ALL THE STUFF IT DERIVES FROM!
      ALL THE SHOULDERS OF ALL THE GIANTS I STAND UPON!

   So, I have my eye towards certain a very particular goal, and a very particular way of meeting
   it: get as many wormholes out as fast as possible, with a _very_ small eye toward at least 
   being able to tune for hitting the x00's; but mostly such that we can help out THE FOLKS THAT
   HAVEN'T HIT 1,000,000 YET!

   That's right, rather than focusing on how to get yet another group to 100mil; or what-have-you,
   or to up the speed at which it happens, especially with all I'm observing with folks not paying
   attention to what IMO are some fairly large issues; but most of all, just the huge negative 
   vibe that I started to get off the whole deal, even as such generous efforts were being made
   on behalf of everyone... 

   From those who would troll to those who are far far too focused on the fact that there are 
   those who would troll, it's just this glut of negative energy that I am not interested in 
   being a part of today. Instead, I want to be a part of this, in a way that I have some modicum
   of control; hell, at this point I don't even know that I'm going to be able to pay my rent next
   month or how we're going to survive, but I do know that my calling has something to do with 
   figuring out to deal positively with these things, for myself, and maybe even someday to help
   others through as well.

   And if nothing else, maybe just have some fun and at least bring some joy in the meantime.

   So, without further ado. 


 Keep in mind this is super-ultra-pre-beta right now and needs some real tuning. We're not going
 to get a chance to tune much. The goal is to make a script that between, say, 10 people can 
 successfully/easily help most teeny rooms get to 1-2mil in 12 hours. Seeing as how there isn't 
 much time I'd better get on it.
